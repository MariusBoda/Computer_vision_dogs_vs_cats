# Plant Species Classification using Computer Vision

This project focuses on classifying house plant species based on a dataset sourced from Kaggle: [House Plant Species Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kacpergregorowicz/house-plant-species).

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a machine learning model capable of classifying plant species based on the provided image data. The primary tools and technologies used include:

- **PyTorch** for building and training the deep learning models.
- **Docker** to containerize the application and streamline the development and deployment process.

## About the Dataset

The dataset contains **14,790 images** categorized into **47 distinct plant species**. These images were collected from Bing Images and manually curated by non-experts. The primary motivation for compiling this dataset was to classify plant species as either toxic or safe for cats.

### Key Features:
- **Total Images**: 14,790
- **Number of Classes**: 47
- **Image Source**: Bing Images
- **Curation Method**: Manual cleaning by non-expert

### Dataset Composition:
The dataset has a varied number of images per class, with some well-represented classes and others having fewer images:
- **Well-represented Classes**: 
  - Monstera Deliciosa: 547 images
  - Dumb Cane: 541 images
  - Chinese Evergreen: 514 images
- **Under-represented Classes**:
  - Yucca: 66 images
  - Kalanchoe: 130 images
  - Asparagus Fern: 169 images

### Image Characteristics:
- Images vary in quality and resolution.
- Includes both whole plant images and close-ups of specific plant parts.
- Plants are shown both indoors and outdoors.
- Images are organized into separate folders based on plant category.

**Note**: Due to copyright considerations, the dataset is for personal use only.
