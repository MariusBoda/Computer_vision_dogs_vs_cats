# Dog and Cat Image Classification

### Tools and Technologies

- **PyTorch**: For building and training deep learning models.
- **Docker**: To containerize the application and manage dependencies.

## Overview

This dataset is designed for image classification tasks, featuring a balanced collection of images of dogs and cats. It includes a total of **1,000 images** with an equal distribution of **500 images of dogs** and **500 images of cats**. The images are standardized to a resolution of **512x512 pixels**.

## Dataset Details

- **Total Images**: 1,000
- **Dog Images**: 500
- **Cat Images**: 500
- **Image Resolution**: 512x512 pixels
- **File Format**: .png
- **Source**: Images generated using Stable Diffusion 1.5

## Usage

This dataset is ideal for various tasks, including:

- **Binary Classification**: Distinguishing between two categories (dogs vs. cats).
- **Image Recognition and Processing**: Enhancing skills in image analysis and manipulation.
- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning Model Training**: Building and training models for image-based tasks.

## Project Implementation

To streamline the development and deployment process, Docker is used. Docker allows for containerization of the application, ensuring a consistent environment across different systems.
