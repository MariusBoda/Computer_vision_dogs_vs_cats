The dataset was compiled by collecting images from Bing Images and manually curating them, although not by professional biologist. I collected this images for a project aimed at classifying plant species as either toxic or safe for cats.\n\nKey Features:\n- Total Images: 14,790\n- Number of Classes: 47\n- Image Source: Collected from Bing Images\n- Curation Method: Manual cleaning by non-expert\n\nDataset Composition:\n- The number of images per class varies significantly, ranging from 66 (Yucca) to 547 (Monstera Deliciosa).\n- Some well-represented classes include Chinese evergreen (514 images), Dumb Cane (541 images), and Monstera Deliciosa (547 images).\n- Classes with fewer images include Yucca (66 images), Kalanchoe (130 images), and Asparagus Fern (169 images).\n\nImage Characteristics:\n- Images vary in quality and resolution.\n- The dataset includes both whole plant images and close-ups of specific plant parts.\n- Plants are placed indoor and outdoors\n- Images are organized into separate folders for each plant category.\n\nThe current dataset is for personal use only due to copyright considerations."}
